# Jr-Penetration-Tester-Try-Hack-Me-
Professional penetration testing write-ups for Try Hack Me labs and challenges I have completed, following a structured methodology (Reconnaissance, Enumeration, Exploitation, Privilege Escalation).


Findings: Service versions, open ports, interesting endpoints.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Enumeration
- Explore each service found in Recon.
- Check web directories, login pages, parameters.
- Note *why* these might be interesting (potential attack surface).

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploitation
- Explain the vulnerability exploited.
- Why this method was chosen over others.
- Show relevant commands, but also **explain the reasoning**.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Privilege Escalation (if applicable)
- Method used (Kernel exploit, misconfig, file permissions, etc.)
- Why it worked.
- Commands executed.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Post-Exploitation (if applicable)
- Data gathering
- Persistence methods
- Clean-up steps

---

## üß† Key Learnings
- Main takeaways from the lab.
- Mistakes made and how you corrected them.
- Security best practices that could have prevented the vulnerability.
